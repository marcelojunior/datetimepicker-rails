### Calling the generator

After you install datetimepicker and add it to your Gemfile, you may need to run the generator.
The generator will create the custom field definitions for Simple Form in your project. There are 3
custom field definitions. The generator look at the app/inputs directory of your project and create
only those custom field definitions that are not already exists in your project. If you have a custom
input with the same name the generator does not overwrite it.

To run the generator is optional, it is up to you to write your own definitions for Simle Form if you
need it at all.

The datetimepicker-rails is using the following custom field definitions:

    datetime_picker_input.rb    # for fields with :as => :datetime_picker
    date_picker_input.rb        # for fields with :as => :date_picker
    time_picker_input.rb        # for fields with :as => :time_picker

To run the generator use the following command:

    $ rails generate datetimepicker_rails:install


### Using datetimepicker-rails

Just call datetimepicker() with any selector.

#### HTML

```html
<input class="datetimepicker" type="text" >

<script type="text/javascript">
    $('.datetimepicker').datetimepicker({
        language: 'hu',
    });
</script>
```

#### Simple_Form

```html
<%= f.input :start_date_time, :as => :datetime_picker %>

<%= f.input :closing_date, :as => :date_picker %>

<%= f.input :begin-at, :as => :time_picker %>
```

The scripts below will be included, when you use the "require bootstrap-datetimepicker/pickers". If you
need different activation scripts, ignore the //= require bootstrap-datetimepicker/pickers line in
app/assets/javascripts/application.js.

```javascript
    $('.datetimepicker').datetimepicker({
        pickSeconds: false
    });

    $('.timepicker').datetimepicker({
        pickDate: false,
        pickSeconds: false
    });

    $('.datepicker').datetimepicker({
        pickTime: false
    });
```

### Date and time formating

Specify your intended date and time formats in your config/locales/en.yml or related language file as follows:

    en:
      datepicker:
        dformat: '%d/%m/%Y'        # display format of the date (this is the default, can be ommited)
        pformat: 'dd/MM/yyyy'      # picking format of the date (this is the default, can be ommited)
        weekstart: 0               # the week starts on Sunday (this is the default, can be ommited)
      timepicker:
        dformat: '%R'              # display format of the time (this is the default, can be ommited)
        pformat: 'hh:mm'           # picking format of the time (this is the default, can be ommited)
